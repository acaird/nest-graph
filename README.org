#+TITLE: Nest Thermostat Graph

* Introduction

  This is a project to gather temperature information from the Nest
  API for thermostats and [[https://nest.com/thermostats/nest-temperature-sensor/overview/][temperature sensors]] and store it for later
  analysis.  The parts of this are:
   - gathering the data via Nest's API
   - storing the data
   - plotting the data

  My motivation for this is to see if I need more heating capacity in
  a room where I have a Nest temperature sensor that is controlled by
  a thermostat in another room - if the temperature between the two
  rooms is greatly imbalanced, I either need more heat in one of the
  rooms or for that heat to be on its own thermostat.
